The XTIS font project
======================

XTIS is a Times-like typeface for mathematical and scientific publishing, based
on [XITS][0], which is based on [STIX fonts][1]. The main mission of XTIS is to
provide a version of XITS fonts enhanced with the character form, making it
suitable for higher quality mathematic typesetting with OpenType math-capable
layout systems, like Microsoft Office 2007+, XeTeX and LuaTeX.

XTIS fonts are distributed under the [Open Font License][2], version 1.1.
